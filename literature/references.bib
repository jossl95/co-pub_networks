  abstract = {Several studies exist which use scientific literature for comparing scientific activities (e.g., productivity, and collaboration). In this study, using co-authorship data over the last 40 years, we present the evolutionary dynamics of multi level (i.e., individual, institutional and national) collaboration networks for exploring the emergence of collaborations in the research field of ``steel structures''. The collaboration network of scientists in the field has been analyzed using author affiliations extracted from Scopus between 1970 and 2009. We have studied collaboration distribution networks at the micro-, meso- and macro-levels for the 40 years. We compared and analyzed a number of properties of these networks (i.e., density, centrality measures, the giant component and clustering coefficient) for presenting a longitudinal analysis and statistical validation of the evolutionary dynamics of ``steel structures'' collaboration networks. At all levels, the scientific collaborations network structures were central considering the closeness centralization while betweenness and degree centralization were much lower. In general networks density, connectedness, centralization and clustering coefficient were highest in marco-level and decreasing as the network size grow to the lowest in micro-level. We also find that the average distance between countries about two and institutes five and for authors eight meaning that only about eight steps are necessary to get from one randomly chosen author to another.},

  abstract = {The co-authorship network of scientists represents a prototype of complex evolving networks. In addition, it o8ers one of the most extensive database to date on social networks. By mapping the electronic database containing all relevant journals in mathematics and neuro-science for an 8-year period (1991--98), we infer the dynamic and the structural mechanisms that govern the evolution and topology of this complex system. Three complementary approaches allow us to obtain a detailed characterization. First, empirical measurements allow us to uncover the topological measures that characterize the network at a given moment, as well as the time evolution of these quantities. The results indicate that the network is scale-free, and that the network evolution is governed by preferential attachment, a8ecting both internal and external links. However, in contrast with most model predictions the average degree increases in time, and the node separation decreases. Second, we propose a simple model that captures the network's time evolution. In some limits the model can be solved analytically, predicting a two-regime scaling in agreement with the measurements. Third, numerical simulations are used to uncover the behavior of quantities that could not be predicted analytically. The combined numerical and analytical results underline the important role internal links play in determining the observed scaling behavior and network topology. The results and methodologies developed in the context of the co-authorship network could be useful for a systematic study of other complex evolving networks as well, such as the world wide web, Internet, or other social networks. c{\copyright} 2002 Published by Elsevier Science B.V.},

  abstract = {Two approaches for the statistical analysis of social network generation are widely used; the tie-oriented exponential random graph model (ERGM) and the stochastic actor-oriented model (SAOM) or Siena model. While the choice for either model by empirical researchers often seems arbitrary, there are important differences between these models that current literature tends to miss. First, the ERGM is defined on the graph level, while the SAOM is defined on the transition level. This allows the SAOM to model asymmetric or one-sided tie transition dependence. Second, network statistics in the ERGM are defined globally but are nested in actors in the SAOM. Consequently, dependence assumptions in the SAOM are generally stronger than in the ERGM. Resulting from both, meso- and macro-level properties of networks that can be represented by either model differ substantively and analyzing the same network employing ERGMs and SAOMs can lead to distinct results. Guidelines for theoretically founded model choice are suggested.},

Collaboration in science is understood here as a process of pooling and exchanging such resources. We show how diversity of resources engaged in scientific collaboration is related to the structure of collaboration networks. We demonstrate that scholars within their personal networks simultaneously (1) diversify resources in collaboration ties surrounded by structural holes and (2) specialize resources in collaboration ties embedded in dense collaboration groups. These complementary mechanisms decrease individual efforts required to maintain effective collaborations in complex social settings. To this end, we develop a concept of ``pairwise redundancy'' capturing structural redundancy of ego's neighbors vis-{\`a}-vis each other.},

Many network studies of men's and women's collaboration rely on bounded case studies of single disciplines and/or single countries and limited measures related to the collaborative process. We deploy network analysis on the scholarly database Scopus to gain insight into gender inequity across regions and subject areas and to better understand contextual underpinnings of stagnancy. Using a dataset of over 1.2 million authors and 144 million collaborative relationships, we capture international and unbounded co-authorship networks that include intra- and inter-disciplinary co-authorship ties across time (2009--2013). We describe how gender informs structural features and status differences in network relationships, focusing on men and women authors in 16 region-subject pairs. We pay particular attention to how connected authors are (first- and second-order degree centrality), attributes of authors' collaborative relationships (including the ``quality'' and other characteristics of these ties), tendencies towards gender homophily (proportion of same-gender ties), and the nature of men's and women's interdisciplinary and international reach. Men have more advantageous first-order connections, yet second-order collaborative profiles look more similar. Men and women exhibit homophilous attachment to authors of the same gender, consistent over time. There is notable variation in the level of gender disparity within subjects across countries. We discuss this variation in the context of global trends in men's and women's scientific participation and cultural- and country-level influences on the organization and production of science.},

Results show that OpenAlex exhibits a far more balanced linguistic coverage than WoS. However, language metadata are not always accurate, which leads OpenAlex to overestimate the place of English while underestimating that of other languages. If used critically, OpenAlex can provide comprehensive and representative analyses of languages used for scholarly publishing, but more work is needed at infrastructural level to ensure the quality of metadata on language.},

Overcoming the challenges of accessing LinkedIn's network data, we have curated a comprehensive dataset of Spanish women and men executives. This unique dataset includes information about their connections and, more importantly, whom they do not connect with. At the baseline level, our findings indicate a prevalent tendency for preferential attachment, where individuals are more likely to connect with popular contacts. Additionally, there is a pronounced inclination towards homophily, characterized by forming connections based on gender, as well as shared organizational and academic affiliations. Building upon the tenets of Social Identity Theory, we identify significant gender differences on LinkedIn's executive networking. Women executives, positioned as out-group members within executive networks, suffer from a networking gender gap resulting in being under-connected and being connected with less popular individuals. However, our research methodology helps us uncover two different strategies women use to overcome this gap. They rely, more than men, on gender homophily to make contacts. Besides, women executives adopt recategorization strategies exhibiting a higher preference for contacts with shared organizational and academic affiliations than men. These findings disrupt two common assumptions: the fallacy of implied connections based on shared affiliations and the overlooked gender differences in networking pools, therefore exposing two previously unidentified gender data gaps.},

We further analyse the metadata in OpenAlex, the Web of Science and Scopus by journal, finding a similarity in the distribution of source reference counts in the Web of Science and Scopus as compared to OpenAlex. We also demonstrate that the comparison of other core metadata covered by OpenAlex shows mixed results when broken down by journal, where OpenAlex captures more ORCID identifiers, fewer abstracts and a similar number of Open Access status indicators per article when compared to both the Web of Science and Scopus.},

Collaboration networks and their impact on scientific activities thus already attracted some attention in the research community, but no work so far studied possible factors which can influence the network positions of the researchers at the individual level. The objective of this paper is to investigate various characteristics and roles of the researchers occupying important positions in the collaboration network. For this purpose, we focus on the collaboration network among Canadian researchers during the period of 1996 to 2010 and employ multiple regression models to estimate the impact on network structure variables. Results highlight the crucial role of past productivity of the researchers along with their available funding in determining and improving their position in the co-authorship network. It is shown that researchers who have great influence on their local community do not necessarily publish high quality works. We also find that highly productive researchers not only have more important connections but also play a critical role in connecting other researchers. Moreover, although mid-career scientists tend to collaborate more in knit groups and on average have higher influence on their local community, our results specifically highlight the important role of young researchers who occupy mediatory positions in the network which enable them to connect different communities and fuel information transmission through the network.},

Fostering such collaboration between newcomers and established researchers helps keep scientific communities alive while opening the way to innovation. But this is a challenge for scientific communities, especially as little is known about the onset of such collaborations. Prior social network research suggests that face-to-face interaction at scientific events as well as both network-driven selection patterns (reciprocity and transitivity) and patterns of active selection of specific others (homophily / heterophily) may be important. Learning science research implies, moreover, that selecting appropriate collaboration partners may require group awareness. In a field study at two scientific events on technology-enhanced learning (Alpine Rendez-Vous~2011 and 2013) including N = 5736 relations between 287 researchers, we investigated how researchers selected future collaboration partners, looking specifically at the role of career level, disciplinary background, and selection patterns. Face-to-face contact was measured using RFID devices. Additionally, a group awareness intervention was experimentally varied. Data was analyzed using RSiena and meta-analyses. The results showed that transitivity, reciprocity and contact duration are relevant for the identification of new potential collaboration partners. PhD students were less often chosen as new potential collaboration partners, and researchers with a background in Information Technology selected fewer new potential collaboration partners. However, group awareness support balanced this disciplinary difference. Theoretical, methodological, and practical implications of these findings are discussed.},

Its goal is to identify the key factors driving collaboration and the main differences in collaboration behavior across scientific fields and disciplines. Two approaches to modelling network dynamics are combined in this paper: the small-world model and the mechanism of preferential attachment, also known as the process of cumulative advantage. Stochastic-actor-based modelling of co-authorship network dynamics uses data for the complete longitudinal co-authorship networks for the entire Slovenian scientific community from 1996 to 2010. We confirmed the presence of clustering in all fields and disciplines. Preferential attachment is far more complex than a single global mechanism. There were two clear distinctions regarding collaboration within scientific fields and disciplines. One was that some fields had an internal national saturation inhibiting further collaboration. The second concerned the differential impact of collaboration with scientists from abroad on domestic collaboration. In the natural, technical, medical, and biotechnical sciences, this promotes collaboration within the Slovenian scientific community while in the social sciences and humanities this inhibits internal collaboration.},

The resulting statistical properties were compared to findings from previous studies of coauthorship networks at the national and discipline levels. Our results show that both the numbers of publications and authors in Korea have grown exponentially in a 64 year time frame. Korean scholars have become more productive and collaborative. They now form a small-world-ish network where most authors can connect with one other within an average of 5.33 degrees of separation. The increasingly skewed distribution and concentration of both productivity and the number of collaborators per author indicate that a relatively small group of individuals have accumulated a large number of opportunities for co-publishing. This implies a potential vulnerability for the network and its wider context: the graph would disintegrate into a multitude of smaller components, where the largest one would contain {$<$}2~\% of all authors, if approximately 15~\% (57,724) of the most connected scholars left the network, e.g., due to retirement or promotion to higher-level administrative positions.},

This polarization is expressed in different publication strategies. The present article analyzes the complete co-authorship networks in a social science discipline in two separate countries over five years using an exponential random graph model. It examines whether and how assortative mixing in publication strategies is present and leads to a polarization in scientific collaboration. In the empirical analysis, assortative mixing is found to play a role in shaping the topology of the network and significantly explains collaboration. Co-authorship edges are more prevalent within each of the groups, but this mixing pattern does not fully account for the extent of polarization. Instead, a thought experiment reveals that other components of the complex system dampen or amplify polarization in the data-generating process and that microscopic interventions targeting behavior change with regard to assortativity would be hindered by the resilience of the system. The resilience to interventions is quantified in a series of simulations on the effect of microscopic behavior on macroscopic polarization. The empirical study controls for geographic proximity, supervision, and topical similarity (using a vector space model), and the interplay of these factors is likely responsible for this resilience. The paper also predicts the co-authorship network in one country based on the model of collaborations in the other country.},

While existing research primarily examines the impact of collaboration network characteristics on the impact and innovation of individual papers, there is less focus on these characteristics within the context of research projects. To bridge this gap, this study adopts the perspective of project teams and explores the influence of scientific collaboration network structures on the impact and innovation of research outputs. By employing ordinary least squares regression and negative binomial regression methods on a dataset encompassing 21,618 NSF grants and their associated 351,550 publications, we rigorously analyze how specific network characteristics impact the innovation and impact of the research outputs. The results reveal a negative correlation between the count of structural holes and both the impact and conventionality of the team's papers. Meanwhile, the small world of a project team positively correlates with the papers' impact and displays an inverted U-shaped relationship with innovation. Further analysis confirms that there is no interactive effect between structural holes and small world. A series of robustness checks have been conducted, demonstrating that these findings are robust. This study contributes valuable insights for scholars, institutions, and policymakers aiming to enhance research team effectiveness. It underscores the nuanced impacts of network properties on research outputs, offering a new perspective by focusing on project-based team structures rather than individual paper collaborations.},

Our framework draws upon theory and research on information processing, social categorization, coordination, and homophily to posit the influence of cognitive, gender, and country diversity on innovation. Our longitudinal model is based on a unique dataset of 1,354 researchers who helped create the new scientific field of Oncofertility, by collaborating on 469 publications over a four-year period. We capture the differences among researchers along cognitive, country and gender dimensions, as well as examine how the resulting diversity or homophily influences the formation of collaborative innovation networks. We find that innovation, operationalized as publishing in a new scientific discipline, benefits from both homophily and diversity. Homophily in country of residence and working with prior collaborators help reduce uncertainty in the interactions associated with innovation, while diversity in knowledge enables the recombinant knowledge required for innovation.},

Based on career and publication data of virtually all sociologists working in German sociology departments, we test how meritocratic factors (academic productivity) as well as non-meritocratic factors (ascription, symbolic and social capital) influence the chances of getting a permanent professorship in sociology. Our findings show that getting tenure in sociology is strongly related to scholarly output, as previous studies have shown. Improving on existing studies, however, we show specifically that each refereed journal article and each monograph increases a sociologist's chance for tenure by 10 to 15 percent, while other publications affect odds for tenure only marginally and in some cases even negatively. Regarding non-meritocratic factors, we show that network size, individual reputation, and gender matters. Women get their first permanent position as university professor with on average 23 to 44 percent fewer publications than men; all else being equal, they are about 1.4 times more likely to get tenure than men. The article generally contributes to a better understanding of the role of meritocratic and non-meritocratic factors in achieving scarce and highly competitive job positions in academia.},

  abstract = {Scientific research is currently considered one of the key factors in the development of our life. It plays a significant role in managing our business, study, and work more conveniently. One of the important aspects when it comes to scientific research is the level of collaboration among researchers/disciplines. The collaboration between two different disciplines contributes to obtaining more reliable solutions for our everyday issues. Therefore, it is needed to understand the collaboration patterns among researchers and come up with convenient strategies for strengthening this kind of collaboration. In this work, we aim at investigating the patterns of scientific collaboration among researchers across disciplines. To this end, we generate a co-authorship network for several disciplines. The generated network reveals many interesting facts regarding the collaboration patterns among researchers who work in the same/different disciplines. We involve several measurements in this study that evaluate different aspects, which is of interest to the research communities since most of the studies in the literature measure specific aspects. Moreover, we propose a novel metric for measuring scientific collaboration in a research community and use it to benchmark the collaboration among disciplines. Finally, we use the obtained results/facts in providing recommendations for scientific communities.},

  abstract = {Has sociology become more socially integrated over the last 30 years? Recent work in the sociology of knowledge demonstrates a direct linkage between social interaction patterns and the structure of ideas, suggesting that scientific collaboration networks affect scientific practice. I test three competing models for sociological collaboration networks and find that a structurally cohesive core that has been growing steadily since the early 1960s characterizes the discipline's coauthorship network. The results show that participation in the sociology collaboration network depends on research specialty and that quantitative work is more likely to be coauthored than non-quantitative work. However, structural embeddedness within the network core given collaboration is largely unrelated to specialty area. This pattern is consistent with a loosely overlapping specialty structure that has potentially integrative implications for theoretical development in sociology.},

I show that these collaboration networks form ``small worlds,'' in which randomly chosen pairs of scientists are typically separated by only a short path of intermediate acquaintances. I further give results for mean and distribution of numbers of collaborators of authors, demonstrate the presence of clustering in the networks, and highlight a number of apparent differences in the patterns of collaboration between the fields studied.},

  abstract = {Knowing driving factors and understanding researcher behaviors from the dynamics of collaborations over time offer some insights, i.e. help funding agencies in designing research grant policies. We present longitudinal network analysis on the observed collaborations through co-authorship over 15 years. Since co-authors possibly influence researchers to have interest changes, by focusing on researchers who could become the influencer, we propose a stochastic actor-oriented model of bipartite (two-mode) author-topic networks from article metadata. Information of scientific fields or topics of article contents, which could represent the interests of researchers, are often unavailable in the metadata. Topic absence issue differentiates this work with other studies on collaboration dynamics from article metadata of title-abstract and author properties. Therefore, our works also include procedures to extract and map clustered keywords as topic substitution of research interests. Then, the next step is to generate panel-waves of co-author networks and bipartite author-topic networks for the longitudinal analysis. The proposed model is used to find the driving factors of co-authoring collaboration with the focus on researcher behaviors in interest changes. This paper investigates the dynamics in an academic social network setting using selected metadata of publicly-available crawled articles in interrelated domains of ``natural language processing'' and ``information extraction''. Based on the evidence of network evolution, researchers have a conformed tendency to co-author behaviors in publishing articles and exploring topics. Our results indicate the processes of selection and influence in forming co-author ties contribute some levels of social pressure to researchers. Our findings also discussed on how the co-author pressure accelerates the changes of interests and behaviors of the researchers.},

This research addresses differences in men's and women's collaborative positioning and collaborator characteristics in science, and whether network influences on scientists' future productivity may be contingent on gender. Utilizing co-inventor network relations that span thirty years of global life science patenting across sectors, geographic locations, and technological background, I present trends of men's and women's involvement in patenting and their collaborative characteristics across time. Amidst some network similarities, women are less likely to connect otherwise unconnected inventors (brokerage) and have greater status-asymmetries between themselves and their co-inventors. In multivariate models that include past and future activity, I find that some network benefits are contingent on gender. Men receive greater returns from network positioning for brokerage ties, and when collaborating with men. Women benefit from collaborating with women, and are more likely to collaborate with women, but both men and women collaborate with mostly men. I discuss the implications of these results for innovative growth, as well as for policies that support men's and women's career development.},

We find that the four centrality measures are significantly correlated with citation counts. We also discuss the usability of centrality measures in author ranking and suggest that centrality measures can be useful indicators for impact analysis.},

However, these databases often face a critical trade-off: those offering extensive and high-quality coverage are typically proprietary, whereas publicly accessible datasets frequently exhibit fragmented coverage and inconsistent data quality. OpenAlex was developed to address this challenge, providing a freely available database with broad open coverage, with a particular emphasis on non-English speaking countries. Yet, few studies have assessed the quality of the OpenAlex dataset. This paper assesses the coverage by OpenAlex of China's papers, which shows an abnormal trend, and compares it with other countries that do not have English as their main language. Our analysis reveals that while OpenAlex increases the coverage of China's publications, primarily those disseminated by a national database, this coverage is incomplete and discontinuous when compared to other countries' records in the database. We observe similar issues in other non-English-speaking countries, with coverage varying across regions. These findings indicate that although OpenAlex expands coverage of research outputs, continuity issues persist and disproportionately affect certain countries. We emphasize the need for researchers to use OpenAlex data cautiously, being mindful of its potential limitations in cross-national analyses.},
